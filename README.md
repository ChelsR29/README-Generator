# README Generator 

## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using an inquirer package. This project was built to further my understand of Node.js, more specifically I gained knowledge on how to initialize an application, how an inquirer package works, the usages of 'let' and 'const', and how to evaluate/embed expressions dynamically in template literals. This project simplifies the process of creating a README.md file, allowing a project creator to devote more time to working on their project.
